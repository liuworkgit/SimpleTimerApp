# Timer App
An approximation of a timer that can count down from 59 minutes and 59 seconds. This project was coded entirely
in Java and IntelliJ IDEA CE.

This project uses the Junit testing library 5.4.2.

# User Stories
This app should be able to do the following:
1. It should be able to take in a length of time up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds, and count down from it.
2. It should be able to play a sound when it finishes counting down.
3. It should prevent the program from running when an invalid time (wrong length of input, not less than 59 minutes and 59 seconds) is given.

# Future Goals
In the future, I would like to implement the following:
1. Create a GUI that can visually display the time being counted down.
2. Allow for larger times to be inputted.
